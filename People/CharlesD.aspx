Charles earned his both his BS and MS degrees in Civil Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and 2021, respectively. While a graduate student researcher, Charles has worked on a national calibration of a faulting model for unbonded concrete overlays (UBOLs), evaluating effect of superload vehicles on concrete pavements, and computational study on material compatible repairs for concrete pavements. His dissertation topic is on the development of a predictive performance model of doweled concrete pavements. Charles serves as a peer reviewer for several journals in pavement engineering, was named the 2020 Research Assistant of the Year in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the University of Pittsburgh, and was awarded 1st place at in the 3-Minute Thesis competition at the 101st Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board in 2022.
