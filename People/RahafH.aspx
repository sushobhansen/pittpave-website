                Jordan native and the University of Jordan Class of 2019 civil engineering graduate Rahaf Hasan obtained her Master’s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Rowan University in 2021. During her time as a Graduate Research Fellow, Rahaf worked at the Center for Research and Education in Advanced Transportation Engineering Systems (CREATEs), with a focus on Innovative Construction Materials. For her Master’s thesis, she researched electrically conductive asphalt concrete for electrically heated flexible pavement systems, intending to automate ice removal processes and mitigate the pollution effect of de-icing chemicals on the environment. With an aim to diversify the transportation field, Rahaf joined the Philadelphia Student Chapter of Women in Transportation Seminars (WTS) in 2020 as a board member, served as the Social Media Lead, and is now a member of the WTS Pittsburgh Chapter. Currently, Rahaf is pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, with a passion for research directed towards sustainable pavements and a dream that one day she can pass her love for the field to younger generations of engineers.
