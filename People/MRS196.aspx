                Mason is a senior undergraduate student who is graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in April 2022. He will be earning his bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering with a structural concentration. During his undergraduate career, he accumulated approximately three years of work experience through co-op’s and part-time internship with American Bridge Company. Through this opportunity, he was able to improve his skillset and knowledge in temporary structures and bridge erection engineering, in conjunction with refining his experience in structural modeling through the use of finite element programs. After his undergraduate education, Mason plans to continue his study at the University of Pittsburgh to obtain his PhD in Civil Engineering. He is currently assisting multiple grad students with the development of a specific finite element program to analyze various loading conditions on industrial floors.
