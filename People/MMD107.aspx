                Megan is an undergraduate student researcher, and will be graduating in April of 2022 with a B.S. in Civil Engineering, a concentration in structural engineering, and a minor in mathematics. She plans to continue studying at Pitt to obtain her master's degree in pavement engineering and then work in industry after graduation. She has worked with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation twice and, with a master's degree in pavement engineering, hopes to bring a strong knowledge base into bridge and roadway projects in PA. She is assisting multiple graduate students in their projects, but is mainly working on developing a predictive performance model of doweled concrete pavements through laboratory investigation of differential deflections.
