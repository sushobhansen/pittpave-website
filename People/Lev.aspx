                Lev Khazanovich, Ph.D., is an Anthony Gill Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.  His primary research interests are in the areas of concrete mechanics, finite element modeling of slabs-on-grade, and non-destructive evaluation.
            Dr. Khazanovich is an internationally recognized expert in structural modeling, evaluation, and performance prediction of concrete pavements.  He served as a Principal or co-Principal Investigator on many high-profile research projects sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration, Department of Energy, National Cooperative Highway Research Program, Strategic Highway Research program, and state transportation agencies with funding more than $10 million.
            Dr. Khazanovich was instrumental in developing of the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and currently being implemented in many states and internationally.
            He is a current or past member of several Transportation Research Board committees and a past chair of the subcommittee on Advanced Modeling of Rigid Pavements. He serves as an Associate Editor of the International Journal of Pavement Engineering.  Dr. Khazanovich is a founding member of the Academy of Pavement Science and Engineering.  His papers received awards from the Transportation Research Board and International Society for Concrete pavements.
