            <p class="card-text">Undergraduate students have the opportunity to take several courses which focus on pavement materials, design, and analysis. The <b>Curriculum Matrix</b> outlines required courses and includes recommended times to take courses relevant to Pavement Engineering, which include CEE 1714, CEE 1715, and CEE 1333. A full description of all available classes can be found in the <b>Undergraduate Curriculum</b>. Lastly, students can pursue a concentration in geotechnical engineering by taking courses relevant to Pavement Engineering, as outlined in the <b>Areas of Concentration</b> sheet.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Graduate students pursuing a MS or Ph.D. in Civil Engineering have the opportunity to advance their understanding of material science, design, and analysis related to pavements through a large selection of courses. To enable students to select relevant courses from both within and exterior to the Civil Engineering Department, the <b>Graduate Curriculum</b> was compiled. This resource was generated through collaboration between current students, past students, and faculty to present suggested courses for current and prospective students. Degree requirements for graduate students are presented in the <b>MS and PMS Requirements</b> and <b>PhD Requirements</a>. </p>
