    <h3><span class="font-weight-bold">Project Title:</span> Material Compatible Repairs (MCRs) for Concrete Pavements and Bridge Decks  </h3>
    <h4>Objective/Abstract</h4>

    <p style="text-indent: 2rem">
        Partial-depth repairs performed on concrete pavements and bridge decks have not always achieved their expected service life. Incompatibility between the repair material and the in-situ concrete is one of the main reasons that hinders the repair section to deliver the expected performance. Differences in deformation between the repair and in-situ concrete under loading result in an increase of stresses generated at the bond interface, and eventually failure of the repair section. The focus of this study is on investigating the effects of any incompatibility between the repair and in-situ concrete through a laboratory investigation and a computational study. The results suggest that development of a material compatible repair (MCR) is accomplished through the proper selection of coarse aggregate, and the incorporation of internal curing agents to minimize drying shrinkage of the repair material. In addition, compared to conventional repairs, using MCRs reduces the induced stresses at the interface by up to 50%.

    <h4>Key Findings</h4>
    <p>
        Incompatibility between the in-situ concrete and repair material is one of the key parameters that can contribute to a shorter repair life. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of the repair section, it is critical to perform a material compatible repair (MCR) using a PERM with controlled shrinkage. Doing so increases the service life of the repair, improves the ride quality, increases safety, decreases closure time, and reduces costs and material consumption. In this study, it was first shown that stiffness compatibility, thermal compatibility, and controlled shrinkage are the main three compatibility properties for an MCR. Then through a comprehensive laboratory study, it was shown that coarse aggregate type is the key parameter to achieve stiffness and thermal compatibility. In addition, it the incorporation of presoaked lightweight aggregate (LWA) is a promising strategy to control the shrinkage of repair materials. Finally, by conducting computational modeling, it was shown that using a compatible material could reduce the induced stresses in the repair section by up to 50%.

    <h4>Potential Impact </h4>
    <p>
        As listed above, Material Compatible Repairs increase safety and repair service life; while reducing closure time, associated maintenance and material costs, and induced stresses in the repaired section.
