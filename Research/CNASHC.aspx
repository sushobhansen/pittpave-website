    <h3><span class="font-weight-bold">Project Title:</span> Concrete Nanotube Additives for Structural and Highway Concrete </h3>
    <h4>Objective/Abstract</h4>

    <p style="text-indent: 2rem">
        The objective of this project is to determine the effectiveness of carbon nanotubes in improving the compressive strength, tensile strength, density, abrasion resistance, shrinkage reduction, and freeze-thaw resistance in structural and pavement concrete according to PennDOT standards. A comprehensive literature review will be conducted to establish both previously reported benefits of carbon nanotubes in concrete and the variables to be studied in the experimental procedure concerning carbon nanotube type, properties, and concentration. A laboratory investigation into the properties of carbon nanotube-enhanced concrete mixtures compared to standard PennDOT concrete mixtures will be conducted. The benefits and disadvantages of carbon nanotube concrete will be evaluated and recommendations concerning its feasibility for use by PennDOT in structures and highways will be made.

    <h4>Potential Impact </h4>
    <p>
        Improving the performance of bridge deck and pavement concrete through use of a mixed-in additive could potentially reduce the concrete’s reliance on conventional reinforcement for its physical strength and chemical admixtures for resistance to chloride penetration and temperature effects, as well as limiting crack propagation.
