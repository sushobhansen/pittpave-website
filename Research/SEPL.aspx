    <h3><span class="font-weight-bold">Project Title:</span> Superload Effect on Pavement Life</h3>
    <h4>Objective/Abstract</h4>

    <p style="text-indent: 2rem">
        The goal of the project is to assess the distresses and damage caused by superloads to Pennsylvania pavements. This information will indicate to PennDOT how pavement design should be modified to account for superloads. A method of quantifying the loss of pavement life due to permitted overloads will be developed from this work.

    <h4>Key Findings </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The peak fatigue damage caused by superloads occurs when the concrete slab has a large positive temperature gradient </li>

        <li>Superloads can cause significant fatigue damage on thinner concrete pavements (i.e., 8-inch and 10-inch JPCPs), especially when there is not a concrete shoulder to reduce edge stresses </li>

        <li>Superloads may induce significant contact stresses between the dowel and surrounding concrete, which has the potential to result in accelerated socketing. This socketing reduces the performance of the doweled joint. </li>

        <li>Positive temperature gradients cause curling of the slab, which in turn induces higher bearing stresses. </li>

        <li>Tandem axles have the greatest potential for damage, due to overall vehicle weight and proximity of the axles to the doweled joint. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Potential Impact </h4>
    <p>
        By determining the impact of superloads and tandem axles on pavement life, pavement designs can be improved to withstand these superloads. Furthermore, routes for superloads can be adjusted to avoid roads and highways with more vulnerable pavement.
