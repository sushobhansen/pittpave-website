    <h3><span class="font-weight-bold">Project Title:</span> Reevaluating Strength Criteria for Opening Concrete Pavements to Traffic </h3>
    <h4>Objective/Abstract</h4>

    <p style="text-indent: 2rem">
        Opening pavements early to lightweight traffic is a way to reduce lane closure without risking the long-term performance of the pavement. Utilizing lightweight early opening seems to have the lowest impact on current construction methods and potential for cost reduction, while keeping the long-term quality of pavements. Early opening can be done using conventional concrete and considering new opening criteria for light, passenger vehicles. Maturity method and ultrasonic testing will be used to accurately determine when a passenger vehicle can be allowed on an early age pavement. This study will reevaluate Pennsylvania’s current opening standards to determine the minimum strength needed to carry lightweight traffic without effecting pavement life.

    <h4>Potential Impact </h4>
    <p>
        By determining the impact of early lightweight traffic on pavement service life, roads and highways could see earlier (lightweight) service without compromising long term performance.
