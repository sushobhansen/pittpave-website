    <h3><span class="font-weight-bold">Project Title:</span> Poroelastic Modelling of Pore Pressure Development in pavement system and its impact on pavement performance  </h3>
    <h4>Objective/Abstract</h4>

    <p style="text-indent: 2rem">
        Poroelastic modeling of the development of pore pressure in pavement structures subject to traffic load and its impact on pavement performance.
    </p>

    <h4>Equipment/Materials Used </h4>

    <p>The research work is pure computational, therefore, the main tool used to simulate the fully saturated material is Matlab. Abaqus is also used for elastic material. </p>

    <h4>Principal Investigator(s)  </h4>

    <p>Zhe Wan, Lucio Salles de Salles, Lev Khazanovich </p>

    <h4>Sponsors and Collaborators</h4>
    <p>University of Pittsburgh Gill Chair  </p>

    <h4>Current Student(s) </h4>
    <p>Zhe Wan </p>

    <h4>Key Findings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive model is developed for predicting dynamic pore pressure in pavement system under traffic load  </li>

        <li>Base permeability can have a significant impact on pore pressure build up under traffic load. </li>

        <li>Speed of traffic load is another key factor that can affect dynamic fluctuation of pore pressure, especially for pavement with low permeability. </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Potential Impact </h4>
    <p>
        The proposed methodology will lead to a more accurate modeling of moisture effects on pavement performance, which is especially important for roads in flood-prone areas and those at risk of flooding due to climate change.
